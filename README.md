<strong>About the course</strong>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>“Programming Fundamentals”</strong> course extends the previously gained basic coding skills from the <strong>“Programming Basics”</strong> course at the <strong>Software University</strong> and adds additional <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>practical programming skills</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The course covers understanding the basic data types in programming, extracting pieces of code into <strong>methods</strong> with parameters and return value, using the debugger to trace the program execution and find bugs, processing sequences of elements using <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>lists</strong>, using collections, working with <strong>matrices</strong> for processing tabular data, working with <strong>dictionaries</strong> to map keys to values, using <strong>strings</strong> for text processing, and the basics of working with <strong>classes</strong> and objects, using API classes and defining simple classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with the programming techniques, the <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> and <strong>problem solving skills</strong> are advanced by solving hundreds of practical programming problems. All exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with real-time feedback through the SoftUni online judge system. At the end all students take a practical programming exam.</p>
